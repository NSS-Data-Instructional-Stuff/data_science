Use the data available to you in the database in whatever way you think is best in order to answer these questions. You may wish to run a query and then import the results into Python or R to help in your analysis.

1. Do grant dollars seem to be equitably distributed? Is there any connection between grant dollars and change in unemployment?

2. The TNECD puts counties into tiers (see https://tnecd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/incentive-tier-map-20181.pdf). Can you find any connection between unemployment and/or population and the tier to which a county belongs. Does the amount of investment in a county seem to be related to that county's tier?
