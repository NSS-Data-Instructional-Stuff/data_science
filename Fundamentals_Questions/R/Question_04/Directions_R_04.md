The starter code provides a list of Bigfoot sightings from the Bigfoot Research Organization (bigfoot_sightings) as well as the number of wilderness acres by state, as designated under the Wilderness Act (wilderness).

1. First, find the number of Bigfoot sightings per state. Which state has the highest number of sightings?

2. Merge sightings_by_state with the wilderness tibble. Make sure to that your merge preserves all states, including those that have had zero sightings. Which states have zero sightings?

3. Find the correlation between wilderness acres and number of Bigfoot sightings.
