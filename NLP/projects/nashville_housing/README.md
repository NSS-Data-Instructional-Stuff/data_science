## Affordable Housing in Davidson County

An introduction to the terminology surrounding the issue of affordable housing can be found at [the website of the Mayor's Office](https://www.nashville.gov/Mayors-Office/Economic-Opportunity/Affordable-Housing-Basics.aspx). For this project, we will use the terms and definitions listed there.

Housing is considered **affordable** for a particular family or individual if it costs equal or less than 30% of their income. For example, for a family that has an income of $60,000 annually, housing that costs $18,000 per year ($1500 per month) would be considered affordable.

**Affordable housing** is housing that is affordable (30% or less of total income) for households that earn 60% or less of Davidson Countyâ€™s median household income.

**Workforce Housing** is housing that is considered affordable (30% or less of total income) for households that earn more than 60% but less than 120% of the median household income.

**TODO: Find the median household income/area median income for Davidson County/whatever it is that the Mayor's offices uses. We will want to make sure that the whole class is on the same page here and on the same page with respect to estimating housing cost by calculating mortgage payments.**

1. Which areas of Davidson County have seen the most rapid increase in home prices? Which ones are losing affordable housing? You can choose different ways to slice the data - by council district or by zipcode, for example.

2. Affordable housing can disappear in a number of ways. It can occur from existing home prices increasing, but can also occur when older, affordable housing is demolished and replaced with more expensive housing. What areas have seen a large number of instances of this?

3. Another factor that can drive up the cost of housing is if houses are being used as short-term rental properties. (See [this article](https://harvardlpr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2016/02/10.1_10_Lee.pdf) published in Harvard Law & Policy Review.) Which areas of town has seen a large number of short-term rental permits. Have these areas also seen an increase in home prices?

4. Consider the text of the `purpose` column of the permit table. Can you find any differences in the types of text that are contained in this field for areas which are rapidly losing affordable housing versus those that are not? 

5. Can you predict when the value of a home will increase based on the text of the permits associated with a house (along with any other factors that you think might be important)? What words tend to be associated with an increase in home price?

Tips for working with the database:
* Join using the `apn` column. This column shows the assessor's parcel number. You can also join using parid/pin/pid.
* The most recent appraisal value is contained in the `property` table. All older appraisal values are contained in the `assessment` table.
* The actual sales price of a home is contained in the `saleprice` column of the `property` table. Note though, that there are a number of circumstances that would result in a sale price of zero, such as someone inheriting a house. You can get the full ownership history of a property from the `owner` table.
* The assessment table contains both appraisal and assessment values for each property. The appraisal value represents the market value of a property at the time of the appraisal. This is determined by [the Assessor's Office](https://www.padctn.org/), so does not necessarily match up with the sales price of a home if it were to sell. Keep in mind that the last full appraisal was completed in 2017, so this is the most recent value available for the majority of properties.
